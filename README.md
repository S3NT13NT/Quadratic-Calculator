just open the TQC file lol (TQC = The Quadratic Calculator)
if u wanna edit the calculator do it on TQC.py, then open the main
folder with terminal and type:

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed  TQC.py

the exe file will be in "dist" folder.
Temporary files will be in the "build" folder, which you can delete
